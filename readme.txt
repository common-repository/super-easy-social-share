The plugin adds social share links to your website. Includes content buttons and desktop and mobile floating bar.

== Description ==

The plugin's purpose is to quickly add the most popular social network share buttons to your website. It includes share links above or below the content as well as a floating bar for desktop/tablet and fixed footer links on mobile. 
It doesn't use any tracking and won't show your share count but it's lightweight, works right out the box and is very easy to configure.
You can also add in-content social share buttons to individual posts and pages.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin: 

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/se-social-share` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Social Share screen to configure the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to pay to use the plugin? =

No. The plugin is free to use and doesn't have any premium features.

= Can I display my share count? =

No. The idea is to keep it simple. 

= Does it work on mobile? =

Of course. The content share buttons will appear on any device and if your website is responsive then the social share floating bar will appear at the bottom of mobile screens. 
We don't want to give you a plugin that works great on desktop but then you need to pay to get it to work on mobile.
